      <p>Data taken from bicep curl exercises recorded by Velloso et al. 2013 was loaded into the R statistical package and analyzed to look for 5 different classes of bicep curl exercises: 
A- Executed as per given intructions
B- throwing elbows to front
C- lifting dumbbell halfway
D- lowering the dumbbell halfway
E- throwing the hips to front</p>

<p>Velloso et al. extracted a number of features using the a sliding window in output from 9-degree of freedom Razer inertial measurement units (IMU's). The data from these sliding windows was extracted from the training set and analyzed using a Boosting algorithm with trees, the 'gbm' method in R's train function. </p>
